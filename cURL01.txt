=> My Takeaway:

    - Curl is a command line framework to facilitate site data manipulation
    - It's a great tool for testing RestAPIs
    - A seperate installation process is not required as it comes pre built into the git framework
    - learnt how to perform several functions on site data such as real time changing of site data, 
        importing site data, making chages to it, saving to a local file space, etc
